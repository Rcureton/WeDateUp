### Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date, and if you put creativity into it, it'll hopefully be the thing you want to show off most prominently in your portfolio.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing frameworks & tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Pull from everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone.**

For this project, you'll be working on your own and using product development strategies learned in unit 3 to come up with a project proposal that will be reviewed with your instructional team; this proposal is done to make sure you are building **something that can be accomplish in the limited time we have** while making sure it's **something that will challenge you**.

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Build a complete application**
* **Have an impressive design and user experience** that follows *Google's Design Guidelines* and can impress future clients and employers
* **Use at least one API or SDK**
* **Implement thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
* **Be object oriented**
* **Be robust**, and handle cases of failure well (e.g., failed network calls)
* **Be available on the Google Play store**, so it is publicly available


---

#### Code of Conduct

As always, your app must adhere to General Assembly's [student code of conduct guidelines](../code-of-conduct.md).

If you have questions about whether or not your work adheres to these guidelines, please speak with a member of your instructional team.

### Deliverables

* Approval from the instructional team
* A GitHub repository with **a ``research.md`` file** with:
    * A research plan that follows the format in the [research plan worksheet](assets/research-plan-worksheet.pdf)
    * Summaries of your user research including personas using the format in the [personas worksheet](assets/persona-worksheet.ai) and [research highlights](assets/research-highlights-worksheet.ai)
    * Your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    * Screenshots of your **competitive analysis** spreadsheet
    * A problem statement that follows the format in the [problem statement worksheet](assets/problem-statement-worksheet.pdf)
    * A list of your **prioritized** features to match your user user goals
    * Screenshots of your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
* Also in the repository should be project plan in a **a `proposal.md` file** or **a presentation deck in Google Slides, Keynote, Powerpoint** that answers the following questions:
    * What are your overall objectives for the project? What problem(s) are you solving? What user goals are you making possible?
    * What is/are the main takeaways from your research findings? Briefly recap what you learned
    * Who is your target audience?
    * What features will you include? They should map to your user goals. Make sure you offer a coherent rationale for why they were chosen.
    * How will this differentiate from your competitors? What pain points are being addressed?
    * Are there any constraints you have to work with? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.)
    * Is there anything else you think might help us (your stakeholders) understand what you’re proposing?

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Is This Restaurant Good? App
Using Google Places API, view information about the restaurant you are currently standing in (i.e., customer ratings and comments).

##### Weather or Not
Given a place and time, the app tells the user the weather conditions at that moment.

##### Q&A App
Sometimes, using Stack Overflow is overwhelming. Using their API, develop an app that reorganizes their data in a more pleasing way, helping people find answers more efficiently, etc.

##### Apartment or Job Search App
Create an app that makes finding an apartment or job easier. Maybe there is a way to rethink and improve how to match people with such resources!
